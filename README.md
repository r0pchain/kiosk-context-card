# kiosk-context-card
A Lovelace card that utilizes browser_mod and displays different UI elements per-device



# Intro
I started into the Smart Home rabbit-hole in 2018 by rewiring my entire house with GE/Jasco switches and SmartThings. 

As one does, you start to bump into the limits of what you can do in a closed ecosystem, so I gradually shifted into a completely open Home Assistant system to control 80+ switches and lights and ~20 smart outlets, along with 18 third-party integrations; now, my smart home controls everything from my Christmas decor to my humidors. 

A big project this year was to integrate a dozen Samsung A9 tablets into my walls for fine-grain control of the house and replicate intercom "drop in" features that I have in my phasing-out Alexas. The problem is that nobody wants to maintain 12 simultaneous frontend dashboards to display context-specific content (e.g. prioritize lights and switches in the room that the tablet-kiosk is in). Thus, the need to develop a "kiosk-contextualized content card" came to be.

# Usage

This assumes you already have browser_mod installed and are using a recent version of HA (tested with 2025.10.1). 

First, you need to add kiosk-context-card.js to your Lovelace dashboard as a resource. Most of this code is to reliably probe browser_mod and provide an interface for the frontend to key off of. 

If the endpoint's browser_mod is mapped, it will display the elements for that map. If an endpoint isn't mapped, it will display what's in "default." If "global" is defined, it will show that content for every endpoint. 

Then, add a card in Lovelace with your browser_mod device mapping to kiosk-context-card and what you want to display per-device. I've included a sample YAML that demonstrates how it might work for your environment.
